I've got some sad family related stuff going on, so that's why I haven't been updating. I'll be delaying the pizza party until I'm ready, and I've made all of the post intermission <b>- spoiler alert in the case you haven't read the url or talked to me -</b><i> it's the squad (minus orangery may he rest in peas) going to space camp.</i> I'll have another update when I've got something else to say. Assuming I don't forget about this.<br>

Well, the concert was canceled. I love storms, but why today? Gentoo is working well though so that's good.<br>

I'm sorry about the recent slowdown of updates. I got Gentoo working well, but I guess I forgot to do something for my tablet. I'm working with that now. I'm thinking about dedicating part of my site to pens and inks, but I'll add more to that idea later. <br>

Sorry about no updates for awhile. I hope to get back to a more regular schedule before camp stops me from updating at all for two weeks.
