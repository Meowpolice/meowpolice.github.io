I've got some sad family related stuff going on, so that's why I haven't been updating. I'll be delaying the pizza party until I'm ready, and I've made all of the post intermission <b>- spoiler alert in the case you haven't read the url or talked to me -</b><i> it's the squad (minus orangery may he rest in peas) going to space camp.</i> I'll have another update when I've got something else to say. Assuming I don't forget about this.<br>

School is over and I'm making more comics. The game is coming along well and I'm going to see metal night tomorrow at warehouse live!!<br>
